## Labeling Methodology

Each issue is labeled with our perception of its impact on the Internet Computer, how long it may take to implement, and a current assessment of its progress. Below is a loose explanation of each label's meaning. Feel free to challenge and improve these labels by opening issues with your constructive criticism.

### Impact

#### High impact

Generally related to critical security features, anything that could be an existential threat to the existence of the Internet Computer or its applications, or anything that would provide absolutely enormous benefits.

#### Medium impact

These issues would be excellent additions to the Internet Computer, but are not absolutely critical to its success.

#### Low impact

Generally applications that ride on top of the Internet Computer.

### Time to Implement

#### Short-term

~1-2 years

#### Medium-term

~3-5 years

#### Long-term

~5+ years

### Progress

#### Idea

It's just an idea in one or a few minds. It's mainly been discussed privately, or mentioned a few times in public areas like Twitter.

#### Traction

The idea is spreading to more than a few minds. There is significant public discussion of the issue, and conensus around its implementation is visible and forming.

#### Implementing

Some entity (an individual, a company, a DAO, DFINITY, etc) has shown a reasonably likely determination to take the issue and implement it or make significant progress on its implementation.
